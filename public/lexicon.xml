<!--
To be honest, the pronunciation of almost all words was in my view really good. The most problems that occurred, were
foreign words from different languages as also names from different languages. These were pronounced in an english
way. I added some to the dictionary, but in my view a dictionary is not the right place to correct these kinds of
problems, since in theory all foreign words/names would need to be added here. It would be more efficient
if the system itself could recognize the foreign language and fetch the correct pronunciation.
Furthermore, I added the word 'controversy' in the lexicon. Actually, it was pronounced correctly in American English.
The British English pronunciation (stress on second syllable) seems nonetheless more natural to me, so I switched
the accent to BE in that case.

Apart from the single words, the pronunciation problems were more on sentence level. Sometimes, the breaks were too long
("What can I do for you, [break] Dominik?") or ar question was pronounced more as a statement (no pitch change in the end).
But these problems can't be solved, with a lexicon.
